    description: "In this lesson we'll use yarn and yarn workspaces to create a monorepo that includes a web creat-react-app, a react-native app, and shared code. We'll use `react-app-rewired` and `react-app-rewire-babel-loader` to rewire the create-react-app configuration to allow babel to process the shared code from workspace. We'll also use `crna-make-symlinks-for-yarn-workspaces` and `metro-bundler-config-yarn-workspaces` to configure the react-native app to be able to find the shared code in the workspaces.",
