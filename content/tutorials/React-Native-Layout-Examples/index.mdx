Flexbox layout takes a bit getting used to. It's surprisngly simple but after so many years of box model css layout it throws you for a loop.

Some examples



## Percentage height sections

These are seemingly simple to do in CSS. Specify `height: 50%` and you get a magical 50% height. Yeah I'm over simplifying it but in general that's what you get. In flex it's different.

This percentage based layout question was asked here [https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/364](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/364).

Laying out login screens may require significant white space. To accomplish % based layout we can use the `flex` property along with `flexDirection`.

Say you want 3 sections. Top `50%`, then two `25%` sections.

Our code would look something like this

```javascript
var SampleApp = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
      return (
          <View style={styles.container}>
              <View style={styles.halfHeight} />
              <View style={styles.quarterHeight} />
              <View style={[styles.quarterHeight, {backgroundColor: '#CCC'}]} />
          </View>
      )
  }
});

var styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        flexDirection: 'column'
    },
    halfHeight: {
        flex: .5,
        backgroundColor: '#FF3366'
    },
    quarterHeight: {
        flex: .25,
        backgroundColor: '#000'
    }
});

```

This makes it look like percentages, however what actually is happening is just ratios.

The ratios are easier to represent with non-decimals. Equivalent code to the above would look like.

```javascript
var styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        flexDirection: 'column'
    },
    halfHeight: {
        flex: 2,
        backgroundColor: '#FF3366'
    },
    quarterHeight: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: '#000'
    }
});

```

That's saying that the `halfHeight` container should take up twice as much space, and the `quarterHeight` should take up one amount of space.
The actual numbers depend on screen size, and/or also derived from parent containers. So we can't attach specific heights.

It just means " `halfHeight` should take up 2 units of height where `quarterHeight` takes up 1 unit/half as much height as the `halfHeight` container".

## React-Native Example Screens

Not being very good at flexbox I figured what better way than to create a bunch of layout examples to practice.
That's when I saw [http://www.invisionapp.com/do](http://www.invisionapp.com/do). It has a bunch of beautiful layouts, so I am attempting to recreate some.

You can check out the repo here [https://github.com/browniefed/react-native-screens](https://github.com/browniefed/react-native-screens)

I've made them all runnable on `rnplay.org`.
