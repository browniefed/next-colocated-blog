    description: "In this lesson we'll take a look at how to render a basic line graph using D3, and VX. We'll move on to analyzing how to add some interactivity that will render a line where ever the user hovers using `bisect` from D3. Then we'll show how to render another line path using the scales and manipulating our data. Finally we'll add another line split so we're rendering 2 line paths.",
