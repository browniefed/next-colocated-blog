    description: "In this lesson we'll use `react-native-vector-icons` to add play/paused buttons, a seek bar, and the duration of the video. We'll use the `onLoad`, `onProgress`, and `onEnd` callbacks to track the video progress. We'll use the `react-native-progress` to create an animated progress bar for us. Finally with `TouchableWithoutFeedback` we will add a tap to seek interaction to jump to specific times in the video.",
