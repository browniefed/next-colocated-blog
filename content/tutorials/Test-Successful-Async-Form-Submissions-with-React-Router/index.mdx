    description: "In this lesson we'll explore how to test that an async form submission successfully happened using Jest. We'll also take advantage of react-testing-library to render our react components to a fake dom. We'll use `MemoryRouter` to mock what a browser would normally do in the event of a transition, and create a fake component route to confirm that the submission successfully redirected us to the url we wanted.",
