    description: "We'll show how to build a reusable `ScrollView` and `ScrollElement` component without adding any additional DOM elements. We'll take advantage of `React.cloneElement`, `React.Children.only`,`findDOMNode`, and `context` to build a registry of scrollable elements in the list. Then we'll use `ref` on the `ScrollView` to expose a way to animate to any item at any scroll position in the list.",
